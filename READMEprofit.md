# Profit Prediction

In this project, we have predicted profit and their differences with actual values, with respect to their differemces in negative and positive.
## Description

- We used Linear Regression Model for this project.
It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.

The linear regression model provides a sloped straight line representing the relationship between the variables.

- various graphical approach to visualise data after the step of data cleansing and data reading.


## Libraries and Algorithms
-  matplotlib
-  pandas
-  numpy 
-  seaburn
- Linear Regression
## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```
- We got a testing result of 88% in our regression model.
